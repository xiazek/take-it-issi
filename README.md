# take-it-issi

A responsive university schedule application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development Mode

To launch the application in development mode with hot-module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in the terminal).

## Production Mode

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist` folder containing the optimized static files.

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

Since this is a static site, you can deploy the contents of the `dist` folder to any static hosting service like GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
